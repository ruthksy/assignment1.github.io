<img src="punggolsettlement.jpg" alt="Punggol Settlement" style="float:left;width:600px;height:400px;">
<br>
The Punggol Settlement is a bespoke food and beverage specialised development concept envisioned and materialised by its developer, The Colonial Settlement Pte. Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Fragrance Group Limited), to revive old Punggol and bring it back to its former glory and more as the dining destination of the North-Eastern sunrise pinnacle of our tropical island city state. 
<br>
<br>
Rapid urban planning with land acquisition / relocation policies by the state authorities of the past 2 decades had displaced the food & beverage geocentric of timeless Punggol away from its original seafront pinnacle.
<br>
<br>
Sited on the original general area of this vintage food and beverage location of the days of yore in pre-millennial Singapore, The Punggol Settlement is Punggol re-established, rebooted, and ready for a wave of delectable dining and entertaining eats, dollops of desserts and rejuvenating recreation - all to be experienced in harmonious symbiosis in natural cohesion with the flora, fauna, and vast peripherally encompassing seafront of the redeveloped and constantly evolving Punggol Point of today...

<h3 id="SAFRA" style=color:white;font-size:40px;margin-left:20px;>History</h3>
<p style= font-size:20px;color:white;margin-left:20px;>
Punggol was a fishing village occupied predominantly by Malay settlers. As more Chinese immigrants settled in Punggol, they engaged in plantation work, poultry farming, and pig-rearing activities.
<br>
<br>
The Punggol of today is very different from its rural past. The blueprint for Punggol 21 was first unveiled in 1996 by the former Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, with the vision of developing Punggol 21 as ‘A Waterfront Town of the 21st Century’.
<br>
<br>
In September 2007, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong unveiled new plans under the Remaking Our Heartland (ROH) programme. Punggol was selected as one of the pilot towns under the ROH programme, with new strategies and plans formulated to reinforce and realise the vision of Punggol as a waterfront town. One of the plans was to dam up Sungei Serangoon and Sungei Punggol, and introduce a man-made waterway through the town to connect these 2 reservoirs, opening up opportunities for waterfront living.
<br>
<br>
In 2010, Punggol was selected for development as Singapore's first Eco-Town, to enhance the living environment in its estates and encourage residents to do their part for the environment. Punggol also serves as a ‘living laboratory’ for HDB to test new ideas and technologies in sustainable development, and integrate urban solutions to create a green living environment. One of the first eco-friendly housing projects in the town was Treelodge@Punggol.
<br>
<br>
The vision for waterfront living was realised with the development of housing projects along Punggol Waterway such as Waterway Terraces I and II, and Waterway Ridges. In 2014, Punggol Northshore was announced as the first nature-centric district to test-bed smart technologies in public housing. These include an intelligent parking demand monitoring system, sensor-equipped lighting in common areas and smart waste management. Housing projects in the newest Punggol Point District, including Punggol Point Crown and Punggol Point Cove, were launched in 2019. Their designs pay tribute to the town’s rich heritage as a rustic fishing village.
